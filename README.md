Description: 
Hello Peer Reviewer and grader, this assignment was meant to build on HW2 by reorganizing the structure of the repository and create tests to confirm the functions in the notebook work in the installable package. However, I've been battling food poisoning and a terrible cold for the last two weeks, so I definitely did this assignment incorrectly.
